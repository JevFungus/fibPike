# fibPike
a somewhat over the top fibonacci program writen in Pike.
## Guide:
To use the program you must have Pike installed. To run the program simply type `./fib.pike <mode> <number>` in the directory you have fibPike downloaded. You can also use `./fib.pike <mode>` or `./fib.pike` to be asked for the missing info at runtime.
### Modes:
- count: counts up to the nᵗʰ number in the fibonacci sequence, excluding 0.
- fetch: fetchs the nᵗʰ number in the fibonacci sequence, excluding 0.
#### notes:
- it starts at 1 because I was to lazy to fix it.
- I tried to make sure it would work if someone else downloaded it but I may have messed up. Please let me know if you have issues.
